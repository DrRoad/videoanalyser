# videoanalyser

Small shiny app to upload a video and extract images, these images are then run through a vgg-16 network to tag. 

You need ffmpeg and the keras library to run this app.

appminuUI.R is making use of miniUI, which is a bit more optimised for mobile screens.

FAMILIE_KRUYS_SEIZOEN3_TRAILER_VANAF_DEF.mp4 in this repo is an example mp4, it's a trailer of a Dutch comedy.

Cheers,
